# firstYouTubeProject

Hi, Mircea here, is 11/20/2022 6:52 PM, Sunday, I want to become an oline code teacher, this is my first project, no idea if it will work or not.

I want to do a draw table (like paint), but u can draw using your camera, put your finger in the air and when u move it the paint will appear on the screen, something like this.

I will user JavaScript, or TypeScript, maybe js, not sure.

Enough for today.

Whoever you are have a nice day.
